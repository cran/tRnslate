ChangeLog tRnslate

Author: Mario A. Mart√≠nez A.

2021-07-07 - Version 0.0.3

* Released version.
* Simplified syntax.
* Debug enabled.
* Reduce output extension when there are too many empty lines.

2020-02-11 - Version 0.0.2

* Allows different characters for chunks or inline R code (important for aTools and tmplate).
* Patterns in delete_comments are specific for tRnslate. It allows to remove comments at the end of line.

2019-11-21 - Version 0.0.1

* Logic for template creation including inline R code.
* Translate templates to any type of file.
* Translate inline R code.
* R chunks started by default by @r or @R. However, they needed to start just at the beginning of line (^@r or ^@R). Now there can be empty space before them (^[[:blank:]]*@r or ^[[:blank:]]*@R) which is useful for indented templates.
* Fix to replace_r_code so that lines of chunks of R code without output
can be deleted in the translated template.
* Fix to long R code chunks translation. Now they can be separated with
empty spaces, so that each chunk produces different output.
* Now assignation and output chunk need to be separated by empty line.
* Vignette updated to reflect these changes.
